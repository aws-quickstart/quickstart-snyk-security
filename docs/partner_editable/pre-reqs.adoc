===== Automated configuration for Amazon ECR
If you deploy Snyk Security using the automated configuration option for Amazon ECR, obtain an API authentication token. The token automates the creation of organizations and ECR integrations within Snyk.

You may use either your personal account token, available via your Snyk account's settings page as shown in <<settings2>>, or a service account token. Service account tokens can be generated through the **Settings** page for your organization within Snyk, as shown in <<settings3>>. For more information, see https://docs.snyk.io/features/integrations/managing-integrations/service-accounts[Service accounts^].

NOTE: An automated integration of Amazon ECR with Snyk requires a paid Snyk subscription.
