Regardless of which quickstart option you choose, log in to your https://app.snyk.io/[Snyk Account], as shown in <<settings1>>, and obtain your Organization ID.

If you are deploying Snyk Security with full integration or solely for Amazon ECR, obtain an API authentication token. This token is used to automate the creation of ECR integrations within Snyk.

You may use either your personal account token, available via your Snyk account's settings page as shown in <<settings2>>,
or a Service account token.
Service account tokens may be created via the Settings page for your Organization within Snyk as shown in <<settings3>>. For more information regarding Snyk service accounts, visit https://docs.snyk.io/features/integrations/managing-integrations/service-accounts[docs.snyk.io].

:NOTE: Automated configuration of ECR integrations with Snyk require a paid Snyk subscription.
