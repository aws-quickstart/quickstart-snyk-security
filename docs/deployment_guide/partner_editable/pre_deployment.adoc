=== Snyk AWS account numbers

For IAM roles to function, you must input values for the *Snyk Container AWS account number* and *Snyk Cloud AWS account number* parameters. These values are provided below.

* Snyk Container AWS account number: `198361731867`
* Snyk Cloud AWS account number: `370134896156`

WARNING: This deployment enables Snyk to assume an IAM role in your AWS account.

=== [Optional] Automatic installation for Amazon ECR
To deploy the automatic installation option for Amazon ECR, obtain an API authentication token. AWS Lambda and the Snyk API are used to automate the creation of organizations and ECR integrations within Snyk.

You may use either your personal account token, available through your Snyk account's settings page, as shown in <<settings2>>, or a service account token. Service account tokens can be generated through the **Settings** page for your organization within Snyk, as shown in <<settings3>>. For more information, refer to https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/service-accounts?utm_campaign=Snyk-Security-QS&utm_medium=Partner&utm_source=AWS[Service accounts^].

NOTE: Automatic installation requires a paid Snyk subscription to use the Snyk API.
