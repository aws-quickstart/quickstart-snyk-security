//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a Partner account. If there are none leave this file empty.

== Pre-deployment steps

=== Prepare your AWS account

This Partner Solution assumes that you already have at least one Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) as well as other AWS resources deployed in your account.

=== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account
During deployment, you must enter your Snyk organization ID. To find your Snyk organization ID, refer to https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/before-you-start-set-the-organization-for-the-cli-tests/finding-the-snyk-id-and-internal-name-of-an-organization[Finding the Snyk ID and internal name of an Organization^].

=== Snyk AWS account numbers

During deployment, enter the folllowing values for the *Snyk Container AWS account number* and *Snyk Cloud AWS account number* parameters. These parameters are required to enable the deployed IAM roles to function.

* Snyk Container AWS account number: `198361731867`
* Snyk Cloud AWS account number: `370134896156`

WARNING: This deployment enables Snyk to assume an IAM role in your AWS account.

=== [Optional] Automatic installation for Amazon ECR
To deploy the automatic installation option for Amazon ECR, obtain an API authentication token. AWS Lambda and the Snyk API are used to automate the creation of organizations and ECR integrations within Snyk.

You may use either your personal account token, available through your Snyk account's settings page, as shown in <<settings2>>, or a service account token. Service account tokens can be generated through the **Settings** page for your organization within Snyk, as shown in <<settings3>>. For more information, refer to https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-admin/service-accounts?utm_campaign=Snyk-Security-QS&utm_medium=Partner&utm_source=AWS[Service accounts^].

NOTE: Automatic installation requires a paid Snyk subscription to use the Snyk API.
